      "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (aka. IIIT-Delhi or IIIT-D) was created as a State University by an act of Delhi Government (The IIIT Delhi Act, 2007) empowering it to do research and development and grant degrees. IIIT-Delhi was officially established on 10th June, 2008 as per this notification in the Delhi Gazette. First class (for BTech(CSE) students) was held on 8th September, 2008.\n"
        "The institute began with its first batch of 60 BTech students in 2008. This first batch graduated in 2012 - the first Convocation took place in November, 2012. By that time, the institute has attracted nearly 30 faculty members, and its academic program consisted of B.Tech., M.Tech. and Ph.D. programs in CSE and ECE. In a relatively short time, it has earned a good reputation in India and abroad for being a center of quality education and research in IT. 2012 turned out be more remarkable year because during the summer of this year, the institute started functioning from its permanent campus in Okhla. Smt. Sheila Dikshit, Chief Minister of Delhi, inaugurated the campus in October, 2012.\n\n"

        "\nThe mission of IIIT-Delhi is to be a global centre of excellence in Information Technology education, training and research. Its twin aims are:\n"

        "1. To carry out advanced research and development in information and software technologies, and in leveraging IT in specific domain areas.\n\n"

        "2. To train and educate, at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, engineers of outstanding ability who can become innovators and new product creators.\n\n"

        "It aims to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in specified domain areas of IT. Towards this end it plans to organize itself as a conglomerate of RnD Centers, some of which would be in partnership with different companies and global organizations.
